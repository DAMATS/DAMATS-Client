Get the code from GitHub [EOxClient repository](https://github.com/EOX-A/EOxClient.git):\r\n\r\n    ```bash\r\n    git clone git@github.com:EOX-A/EOxClient.git\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n0.  Install development enviroment: \r\n\r\n    Make sure [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) and [NPM](https://npmjs.org) are installed\r\n    on your machine and run:\r\n\r\n    ```bash\r\n    cd ./EOxClient\r\n    sudo npm install -g grunt-cli\r\n    sudo npm install -g bower \r\n    npm install \r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    These commands install the needed Node.js packages. In case of any trouble try to use \r\n    reasonable recent version of Node.js. Also note that newer versions of Node.js contain \r\n    the NPM already bundled in the baseline installation. \r\n\r\n0.  Install client dependencies:  \r\n\r\n    The required JavaScript librabries can be installed by: \r\n\r\n    ```bash\r\n    bower install\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n0.  Start the [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) development server:\r\n\r\n    ```bash\r\n    grunt server \r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    this should automatically open a the client on your default web browser, if not point your browser to localhost:9000. \r\n\r\nIf you managed to reach this the last step you can start to hack the code. \r\nThe development server by grunt watches for saved changes in the code and will update the page automatically.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Deploy on a server \r\n\r\n0.  Create deployment package: \r\n\r\n    ```bash\r\n    grunt build\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    This command creates `dist` directory containing the produced deployment \r\n    version. This directory should be then packed by some archiving tool (`zip`, `tar`, `cpio` ... etc.)\r\n    creating the deployment package.\r\n\r\n0.  Put the content of the deployment package to your server and make sure\r\n    the web server can access the `index.html` file. ","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
